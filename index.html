					Hello! I'm glad you made it here. I am Ibrahim Oduola but feel free to call me Ibrahim. I am a 22 year old  full-stack developer. I am also a nautical science graduate cum laude. And no, nautical science isn't related to software development of any kind. It is a course that prepares to navigate ships...yes that's right!. As much as I like being a mariner, I also enjoy the creative side of developers not just in software development but all kinds including AI development which is my fav. And because of that, I had to dedicate myself to learning how to write codes. And thanks to my consistency, I can now do all sorts of things all full-stack developers do, including front-end developemnt or web client designs, server-side logical development, database management, APIs and the likes. You can browse through my projects and feel free to contact me. I'll be happy to talk more. Enjoy the rest of the day.

							<h1><a href="https://ibracodes.github.io/official-page/">My Web Porfolio</a></h1>
							<p>						
								This webpage is my first official web portfolio. It is a static page designed with HTML, CSS and vanilla Javascript and served via github pages. I designed it to be interractive, simple and elegant.
							</p>

							<h1><a href="https://ibracodes.github.io/DASP-docs/">Django Abstract Startpoint</a></h1>
							<p>						
								Mostly whenever I start a new django project, i use django's Abstract base user rather than the default user.
								And instead of writing the codes that enables the AbstracBaseUser all the time, I created Django Abstract Startpoint. With Django Abstract Starpoint, I just have to clone it to my project and run the "AUTO_START" command and it would write all that is necessary for me to use Abstract Base User in my project while i just go straight to writing the important stuff. I also made it an open source program so other developers can use it too.

						<div>
							<h1><a href="http://muslimguide.herokuapp.com/">Muslim Guide</a></h1>
							<p>						
								Muslim guide is a web application I created and maintain to guide muslims daily. It a simple and interractive.
								It is developed using React and Django. I developed both backend and front-end and I am working on making tha API publicly available for free so other developers can use it too. Muslim guide also uses other API's apart from the ones I created for other purposes like the Salah time calculation.
							</p>

						<div>
							<h1><a href="http://www.marinescout.net">Marine Scout</a></h1>
							<p>						
								Marine Scout is a big project currently under development. It is a web application aimed at bringing maritime companies, maritime institutions and maritime students all closer together whiles enabling productive interraction between all. It is also focused on the development of maritime students academically, socially and pyshologically to meet a very high standard.
