		<p>
			Hi! <span class="not-important">I'm glad you made it here!</span> I am Ibrahim Oduola (you can call me Ibrahim). I am a 22 year old enthusiastic python, javascript and full stack web developer. I am also a nautical science graduate cum laude.<span class="not-important"> And no, nautical science isn't related to software development of any kind. It is an academic programme that prepares you to navigate ships...yes that's right!. As much as I like being a seafarer, I relish the creative side of programmers and developers of all kinds including AI development. And for that reason, I dedicated myself to learning how to write codes. And thanks to my consistency, I can now do all sorts of things all competent full-stack developers do, including front-end/web-client development, server-side logical development, database management, APIs and the likes. You can browse through my projects and feel free to contact me on <a href="#email">my email</a>. I'll be happy to talk more. Enjoy the rest of the day. </span>

				<p>
					Marine Scout is an industrial project I am working on. It is aimed at bringing maritime companies, maritime institutions and maritime students all closer together in one global network enabling productive interraction between all. It would also help improve seafarers' competency to a very high standard. I believe that with this project, shortage of seafarers would fall and seafarers' competency would rise significantly.

					Many small scale businesses in developing states find it tough to create and maintain a website to take advantage of the internet. So I created Afro Mart which is a web based market place where business engaged in commerce can harness the power of internet traffic and it's free.

				<p>
					Mostly whenever I start a new django project, I use django's Abstract base user rather than the default user model. And instead of writing the codes to use AbstracBaseUser over and over again, I created an open source program (Django Abstract Startpoint) to automatically write the redundant codes for me immediately I run the "AUTO_START.py" file. So, I just go straight to writing the important stuff.

	<h2 class="topic">Education and Experience</h2>

	<div class="show">
		<h3>Regional Maritime University, Ghana<span>(2015 - 2020)</span></h3>
		<p>
			Following my particular interest in seafaring, I enrolled in RMU to study nautical science in 2015 which is a 4-year undergraduate programme. As you might have guessed, the weather was quite stormy, but I learnt alot and I completed 5 years later with a first class degree.
		</p>
	</div>

	<div class="show">
		<h3>Web Developer @ Sytwise.com</h3>
		<p>
			Being a consistent young man, I try to keep to a productive routine. So at a particular time and place on the school premises, I always see this man working on his computer just like me. Few days later, I had a conversation with this man who is more experienced than I am in software development. Few months later, he asked to see some of the projects I had worked on..which he did..and then told me about his startup (sytwise.com) and offered me a chance to work with him. So I took the opportunity to experience, learn from and contribute to something worthwhile. 
		</p>
	</div>

	<div class="show">
		<h3>Representative to the SRC Parliament <span>(2018 - 2019)</span> </h3>
		<p>
			Just like every other civilized society, governance with all people appriopriately represented is necessary and RMU is no different. In 2018, I was elected to speak for, report on and defend the rights and welfare of every member of my class constituency to the parliament of the Student Representative Council of RMU. This experience taught me one important thing - in a society with different idealogies, listening well to one another is he first step towards progress.
		</p>
	</div>

	<div class="show">
		<h3>Editorial Committee Chairperson NAUSA RMU <span>(2017 - 2018)</span> </h3>
		<p>
			Just below the Student Representative Coucil in RMU, there is NAUSA - NAUtical Student Association which governs the whole department of Nautical Studies. In 2017, I was appointed to lead the Editorial committee of the young association. Fortunately for me, I served with goal-oriented president and vice president. In order to achieve the goals the association set our for, each committee leader, including myself, must ensure that committee team works efficiently and coherently with other committees.
		</p>
	</div>

	<div class="show">
		<h3>Deputy Watch Leader of the RMU Cadet Corps</h3>
		<p>
			Considering the nature of the academic programme pursued, the university (RMU) made it mandatory for seafaring students to undergo a two year cadetship programme. At the end of the first year, executive leaders would be appointed from the then first years to lead both their peers and the next first years. In 2016, I was appointed the deputy watch leader of the cadet corps. This is perhaps the most daunting experience I have ever had because as a naive 18-year, I have responsibility and duty over more than 200 people majority of whom are in their late twenties or even in their thirties. But in the all in all, I pulled through and I did some good job.
